"""
Earliest-deadline baseline: always observe the valid event whose window
closes soonest.

This is a classic scheduling heuristic (EDF — Earliest Deadline First).
It minimises missed events by always prioritising the most time-critical
opportunity.  It knows nothing about science value or tier progress.

The "deadline" here is ``window_end`` — the BJD time after which the
transit/eclipse is no longer observable.

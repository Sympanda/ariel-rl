"""Pure-random baseline: pick uniformly from *all* actions, ignoring the mask.

Unlike ``RandomValid``, this agent does not filter out completed targets or
other invalid events.  It occasionally wastes steps on masked actions and
receives the corresponding penalties.  This makes it a weaker floor than
``RandomValid`` and therefore a more conservative normalisation baseline.
